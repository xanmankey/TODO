Privacy Policy for TODO
=======================

At TODO, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by TODO and how we use it.

If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.

Privacy Policies
----------------

You may consult the source below to find the Privacy information for Heroku, where the back-end for TODO is hosted.

No ads or advertising data are collected directly from TODO, and no partnerships or affiliations have been made with any third party advertising services to place ads on the front-end or back-end. However, this doesn't necessarily guarantee that there will be no ads. Heroku, as of right now, will not inject ads into free hosted websites, but the possibility remains that this changes in the future. If you are receiving ads, it may also be possible that you may have a malicious software (an adware) affecting your experience, so watch out for those.

Children's Information
----------------------

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

TODO does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13 (enforced via Google Play Console age restrictions). If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our App, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

Online Privacy Policy Only
--------------------------

This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our App with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in TODO. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this app. Our Privacy Policy was created with the help of the [App Privacy Policy Generator from App-Privacy-Policy.com](https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/app-privacy-policy-generator/)
